# Credit Score Movement Prediction - ML Project

## 🎯 Business Problem & Solution

**Objective**: Predict whether a customer's credit score will increase, decrease, or remain stable in the next period based on their financial behavior and credit history.

**Business Value**: Enable proactive risk management and targeted customer interventions to improve portfolio performance.

## 🧠 Business Logic & Target Variable

The ML model predicts credit score movement using these business rules:

### **DECREASE** (High Risk - 20.9% of customers)
Customers likely to see credit score decline due to:
- High days past due (>15 days in last 3 months)
- Very high credit utilization (>80%)
- Multiple recent credit inquiries (≥4 in 6 months)
- Poor repayment history (<40% score)
- High EMI-to-income ratio (>35%) with payment delays
- Recent defaults (<6 months ago)

### **INCREASE** (Low Risk - 1.3% of customers)
Customers likely to see credit score improve due to:
- Excellent repayment history (>80% score)
- Low credit utilization (<30%)
- Comfortable EMI-to-income ratio (<25%)
- No recent payment delays
- Minimal credit inquiries (≤1 in 6 months)
- No recent defaults (>24 months)

### **STABLE** (Medium Risk - 77.8% of customers)
Customers who don't meet criteria for increase/decrease

## 🔍 Key Features Used

**Financial Behavior**:
- Credit utilization ratio
- EMI-to-income ratio
- Current outstanding amounts

**Payment History**:
- Repayment history score (0-100)
- Days past due in last 3 months
- Months since last default

**Credit Seeking Behavior**:
- Number of hard inquiries (last 6 months)
- Recent loan disbursed amounts

**Demographics**:
- Age, gender, location
- Monthly income

## 🤖 ML Implementation

**Problem Type**: Multi-class classification (3 classes)

**Models**: RandomForest and XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning

**Key Challenges Addressed**:
- **Class imbalance**: Only 1.3% "increase" cases → Used SMOTE oversampling
- **Feature engineering**: Created ratio features (EMI/income, outstanding/income)
- **Model interpretability**: SHAP analysis for explainable predictions

**Performance**: ~85-90% accuracy with F1-macro score of ~0.80-0.85

## 💼 Business Impact

**Risk Segmentation** enables targeted interventions:

1. **High-Risk (Decrease)**: Proactive credit counseling, hardship programs
2. **High-Opportunity (Increase)**: Premium rewards, credit limit increases
3. **Stable**: Retention programs, predictive monitoring

**ROI**: Early identification of at-risk customers can reduce defaults by 15-25% while targeted upselling to low-risk customers can increase revenue by 10-20%.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Created realistic 25K customer dataset with correlated features
- **Feature Engineering**: Derived business-meaningful ratios and indicators
- **Model Comparison**: Systematic evaluation of multiple algorithms
- **Explainability**: SHAP values for model interpretability and business insights
