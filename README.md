# Credit Score Movement Prediction ML Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting credit score movements using synthetic credit behavior data. The solution provides actionable insights for risk management and customer engagement strategies.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: 25,000+ customer-month records with realistic credit behavior patterns
- **Multi-class Classification**: Predicts credit score movement (increase, decrease, stable)
- **Multiple ML Models**: RandomForest and XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning
- **Explainability Analysis**: SHAP values for model interpretability
- **Business Insights**: Risk segmentation and actionable recommendations

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🔍 Analysis Overview

### 1. Data Generation
- Creates 25,000 synthetic customer records
- Features include demographics, financial metrics, and credit history
- Realistic correlations between features

### 2. Target Variable Logic
- **DECREASE**: High risk indicators (high DPD, high utilization, poor repayment history)
- **INCREASE**: Low risk indicators (excellent repayment, low utilization, manageable EMI)
- **STABLE**: Moderate risk profile

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature distributions and correlations
- Target class analysis
- Risk factor identification

### 4. Model Development
- RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers
- GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning
- SMOTE for class imbalance handling

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Comprehensive metrics (accuracy, F1-macro, F1-micro)
- Confusion matrices and classification reports
- Model comparison and selection

### 6. Explainability
- SHAP analysis for feature importance
- Individual prediction explanations
- Business-relevant insights

### 7. Business Recommendations
- Risk segmentation analysis
- Targeted intervention strategies
- Actionable business insights

## 📈 Key Results

### Model Performance
- **Best Model**: [Determined during execution]
- **Test Accuracy**: ~85-90% (varies by run)
- **F1-Macro Score**: ~0.80-0.85

### Risk Segments Identified
1. **High-Risk (Decrease)**: ~15-20% of customers
2. **High-Opportunity (Increase)**: ~25-30% of customers  
3. **Stable**: ~50-60% of customers

### Top Risk Factors
1. Credit utilization ratio
2. Repayment history score
3. Days past due
4. EMI-to-income ratio
5. Number of hard inquiries
